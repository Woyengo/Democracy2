    <p>
        In this chapter, we explore the mathematics behind personal finance, loans, investments, and retirement planning.

    <p>These problems show us the basic idea behind simple interest: the amount charged is proportional to the principal (amount borrowed) and the time period.</p>

          <p>If you save $200 per month in an account earning 3% annual interest compounded monthly, how much will you have after 5 years?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>This is an annuity problem. Using the annuity formula: <m>F = PMT \times \frac{(1+r)^n - 1}{r}</m></p>
          <p>Where PMT = $200, r = 0.03/12 = 0.0025, n = 5×12 = 60</p>
