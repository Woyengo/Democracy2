  <title>Apportionment and Division</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Another mathematical challenge in most Democratic systems is that of Apportionment. 
        Essentially the problem is one of representation. Seats in the House of Representatives 
        are given to the states based on population. There are 435 seats for 323.1 million people. 
        That works out to <m>323100000/435 = 742758.6207</m> or about <m>742,759</m> people per seat 
        in the House. However, even though North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming all have smaller 
        populations than that they are guaranteed a seat in the House. Also, if you look at the 
        other states, it is very rare that their population is exactly an even multiple of <m>742,759</m>. 
        This section is all about how to fairly appoint seats in a house of representatives, as well 
        as a variety of other tasks that turn out to be essentially the same thing.

      <introduction>
        <p>The Republic of Awoi is a small country consisting of four states North-West (population 69,000), 
        South-West (population 267,000), South-East (population 133,000) and North-East (population 331,000). 
        Suppose that there are 160 seats in the Awoi Congress to be apportioned among the four states based 
        on their representative populations.</p>

    <title>Fair Division</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>The basic issue at all fair division problems can be stated in reasonably simple terms: 
      How can something that must be shared by a set of competing parties be divided among them 
      in a way that ensures that each party receives a fair share? Of course, part of the answer 
      to this question will involve defining what we mean by a fair share.</p>

    <activity xml:id="act-pizza-division">
      <introduction>
        <p>My friend and I decide have pizza for dinner. We order pizza which is half red sauce with 
        pepperoni and half garlic sauce with ham and pineapple. To my friend, pizza is pizza. He has 
        no preference for one type of pizza over another. On the other hand, I have an allergy to oregano 
        and cannot eat any red sauce. It gives me a horrible stomach ache and I'm grumpy for about eight hours.</p>
      </introduction>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>What is a fair way to divide this pizza so that my friend and I both believe we are getting a value of at least 50% of the pizza?</p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>My friend never remembers that I do not eat red sauce. Therefore, he divides the pizza so that each half has exactly half red sauce and half garlic sauce. Am I able to choose a slice where I receive 50% of the value of the pizza?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Yes</p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose instead, I slice the pizza. When I do so, because I value the red sauce part as nothing, I divide the pizza so that one slice is all garlic sauce and the other slice is all red sauce. Have I divided the pizza in such a way that each slice is worth 50% to me?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>No, because one slice is worth 100% and the other 0% to me.</p>

      </task>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>Is there a way that I could divide the pizza in order to have each slice worth 50% to me and have all the red sauce on one of the slices?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Yes. One slice would have all red plus 1/2 of the garlic.</p>

      </task>
      
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>In the case above, which of the slices would my friend choose?</p>

        <solution>
          <p>The larger one.</p>

    <p>We are going to start with the most common method for fair division, that of the divider-chooser. 
    This is the problem where there are two people and one thing to divide. One person has chosen to do 
    the cutting, and then the other person gets to choose which part they want.</p>

      <title>Fair Division Assumptions</title>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Rationality</title>
          <p>Each of the players is a thinking, rational agent seeking to maximize his or her share of the booty <m>S</m>. We further assume that in pursuit of this goal, a player's moves are based on reason alone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Cooperation</title>
          <p>The players are willing participants and accept the rules of the game as binding. The rules are such that after a <em>finite</em> number of moves by the players the game terminates with a division of <m>S</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Privacy</title>
          <p>Players have no useful information on the other players' value systems, and thus if what kinds of moves they are going to make in the game.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Symmetry</title>
          <p>Players have <em>equal</em> rights in sharing the set <m>S</m>. A consequence of this assumption is that at a minimum, each player is entitled to a <em>proportional</em> share of <m>S</m>, that is <m>\frac{S}{N}</m> when there are <m>N</m> players.</p>
