    <introduction>
      <p>
        In 1958, the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community (EEC)
        and instituted a weighted voting system for the EEC's governance.
        The members at that time were France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
        The three largest countries (France, Germany, and Italy) were each given a vote with weight 4,
        Belgium and the Netherlands had votes of weight 2, and Luxembourg's vote had weight 1.
        The quota was 12.
