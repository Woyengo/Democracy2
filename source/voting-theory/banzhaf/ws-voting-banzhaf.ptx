      <answer>
        <p>
            any set of players that might join forces and vote the same way.
In principle, we can have a coalition with as few as <em>one</em> player and as many as <em>all</em> players.
The coalition consisting of all the players is called the <em>grand coalition</em>.
Since coalitions are just sets of players, the most convenient way to describe coalitions mathematically is to use the <em>set</em> notation.

    <answer>
        <p>
            one that has enough votes to win.  A single player coalition can be a winning coalition only 
            when that player is a dictator, so under the assumption that there are no dictators in our 
            weighted voting system (dictators are boring) a winning coalition must have at least two players.

  <title>Finding Critical Voters</title> -->

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the weighted voting system <m>[10 | 6,4,3,2,1]</m>,  
        consider the winning coalition <m>\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\}</m>.  
        Which voter(s) could change their mind and vote “no” without changing the outcome?  
        Which voter(s) must keep voting “yes” for the motion to pass?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The total is 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 15. The quota is 10.  
        - If <m>P_1</m> leaves: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 → motion fails, so <m>P_1</m> is critical.  
        - If <m>P_2</m> leaves: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 → still passes, so <m>P_2</m> is not critical.  
        - If <m>P_3</m> leaves: 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 → still passes, so <m>P_3</m> is not critical.  
        - If <m>P_4</m> leaves: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 → still passes, so <m>P_4</m> is not critical.

    <solution>
      <p>
        - \{P_1, P_2\}: both critical.  
        - \{P_1, P_3\}: both critical.  
        - \{P_1, P_4\}: both critical.  
        - \{P_2, P_3\}: both critical.  
        - \{P_1, P_2, P_3\}: each critical? 11+9+8=28, so if P_1 leaves: 17 (fails); P_2 leaves: 19–9=19–9=19–9=19–9=19–9=19–9= so still winning. Wait! Must check:
        Actually:  
        - If P_1 leaves: 17 → loses → P_1 is critical  
        - If P_2 leaves: 19–9=19–9=19–9= so 11+8=19 → exactly at quota → still winning → P_2 not critical  
        - If P_3 leaves: 11+9=20 → still winning → P_3 not critical  
        - So only P_1 is critical in this coalition.

        Continue:
        - \{P_1, P_2, P_4\}: 11+9+5=25  
          - P_1 leaves: 14 → fails → P_1 critical  
          - P_2 leaves: 16 → fails → P_2 critical  
          - P_4 leaves: 20 → still passes → P_4 not critical

        - \{P_1, P_3, P_4\}: 11+8+5=24  
          - P_1 leaves: 13 → fails → P_1 critical  
          - P_3 leaves: 16 → fails → P_3 critical  
          - P_4 leaves: 19–5=19 → exactly quota → still wins → P_4 not critical

        - \{P_2, P_3, P_4\}: 9+8+5=22  
          - P_2 leaves: 13 → fails → P_2 critical  
          - P_3 leaves: 14 → fails → P_3 critical  
          - P_4 leaves: 17 → fails → P_4 critical

        - \{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\}: sum = 33  
          - Removing any one still exceeds 19, so no one critical.
