                Each League member votes for his favorite candidate.  
                    What percentage of votes did the first-place candidate receive?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                P won with <m>33\%</m> of the vote.
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Since none of the candidates received more than <m>50\%</m> of the votes,
                the League holds a run-off election between the top two candidates.
                Who will win the run-off election?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Q wins with <m>17</m> votes over P's <m>13</m> votes.

                Was anyone eliminated from the run-off who perhaps shouldnâ€™t have been?

        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                R received nearly the same number of votes as P and Q, especially as compared to S.

                Can you think of a better runoff system for the League than a runoff between just the top two candidates?
                What result does it give?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                Eliminate the worst each time.
