            The AP college football poll is a ranking of the top <m>25</m> college football teams in the country
                and is one of the key polls used for the BCS<fn>Bowl Championship Series</fn>.
            The voters in the AP poll are a group of sportswriters and broadcasters chosen from across the country. 
            The top <m>25</m> teams are ranked using a Borda count: each first-place vote is worth <m>25</m> points, 
            each second-place vote is worth <m>24</m> points, each third-place vote is worth <m>23</m> points, and so on. 
            The following table shows the ranking and total points for each of the top three teams at the end of 
            the <m>2006</m> regular season. (The remaining <m>22</m> teams are not shown here because they are irrelevant to this exercise.)

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Given that Ohio State was the unanimous first-place choice of all the voters, find the number of voters that participated in the poll.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <m>\fbox{65}</m>
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the number of second and third-place votes for Florida.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Since Ohio State was the unanimous first-place choice and we are told the other <m>22</m> teams are irrelevant, 
                then we can assume that all the second and third place votes went either to Florida or Michigan.  
                This also means that the voters who didn't put Florida second placed them third. 
                This is all the information you need to solve the problem.
